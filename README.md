# Mapping with ArcGIS

This javascript code will display a map centered in Rexburg, ID using ArcGIS.  The map will contains dots representing all earthquakes in the past week (red > 6, yellow > 4, green > 2, blue < 2).  If you click on a dot, you will see a message showing the actual magnitude and the physical location.

The earthquake data is obtained by reading JSON data from the USGS website (https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/geojson.php).
